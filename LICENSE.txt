The source code files in this directory implement as tightly as possible
algorithms described in the IPOL article :
"Automatic homographic registration of a pair of images, with a contrario elimination of outliers".
They are made available as scientific tools enabling the verification of the
soundness and completeness of the algorithm descriptions.

These source codes implement the SIFT algorithms possibly linked to the patent 
[1]. Compiling or running this code may violate patents in certain countries.
For this reason, the use of the source files "src/third_party_sift_anatomy/*"
